# Aurora Spiral

This code uses the Python Turtle library to create a stunning, spiral pattern that evokes the shimmering colors and ethereal beauty of the Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights). The pattern is formed by drawing a series of connected circles with decreasing radii, with each circle being drawn in a different color from the HSV color space. The colorsys module is used to convert HSV values to RGB colors, creating a smooth transition between colors.
